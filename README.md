## Problem Statement

Airlines operate in a highly competitive environment where operational efficiency and customer satisfaction are crucial for success. This dashboard aims to provide actionable insights into key performance metrics such as flight punctuality, customer feedback, and operational efficiency. By leveraging this data, airlines can identify areas for improvement, streamline operations, and enhance customer loyalty.

## Objectives

- **Analyze Flight Performance**: Track and analyze flight punctuality, delay reasons, and on-time performance.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Measure customer satisfaction through feedback ratings and Net Promoter Score (NPS).
- **Operational Efficiency**: Monitor metrics such as turnaround time, baggage handling efficiency, and crew performance.
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Pinpoint operational bottlenecks and areas causing delays to implement targeted improvements.
- **Enhance Decision-Making**: Provide a data-driven foundation for strategic decisions and operational enhancements.

## Data Sources

- **Flight Data**: Includes flight schedules, delays, cancellations, and reasons for delays.
- **Customer Feedback**: Surveys, feedback forms, and NPS data.
- **Operational Data**: Turnaround times, baggage handling times, and crew performance metrics.

## Steps Followed

### Data Preparation

1. **Data Import**: Loaded airline performance data into Power BI Desktop from Excel and database sources.
2. **Data Profiling**: Used Power Query Editor to analyze data quality and distribution.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Identified and handled errors, missing values, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
4. **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between tables to create a robust data model.

### Visualization and Analysis

5. **Report Theme**: Applied a consistent theme for better readability and aesthetics.
6. **Flight Performance Visualization**: Created charts and graphs to display on-time performance, delay reasons, and average delay times.
7. **Customer Satisfaction Visualization**: Incorporated metrics such as NPS and customer feedback ratings.
8. **Operational Metrics Visualization**: Visualized turnaround times, baggage handling efficiency, and crew performance.
9. **Calculated Columns**: Created calculated columns for additional analysis, such as categorizing delay reasons.
10. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Defined and displayed KPIs to track against targets.

### Deployment and Monitoring

11. **Publish to Power BI Service**: Published the dashboard to Power BI Service for secure sharing.
12. **Sharing and Collaboration**: Shared the dashboard with stakeholders for collaborative analysis.
13. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly monitored the dashboardâ€™s performance and updated it to reflect new data and changing conditions.
